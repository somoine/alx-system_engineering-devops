Post-Mortem: The Case of the Disappearing Web Server
Incident Overview
On August 19th, 2024, our beloved web server decided to go on an unannounced vacation at 3:00 AM, resulting in a complete outage of our site, Starlink Translation Centre. As much as we appreciate hard work, even servers need to stick around during peak hours. So, let’s dive into what happened, how we fixed it, and what we’ve learned (other than that servers have terrible timing).

What Went Wrong?
Imagine this: It's 2:59 AM, and our server is humming along nicely. But then, as if someone shouted "surprise!", the server stops responding. Users were greeted with a page that resembled a 404 error mixed with a sad trombone sound.

Root Cause:
Suspect 1: Misconfigured cron job - Set to restart the server, but instead, it decided to perform a disappearing act.
Suspect 2: Network configuration - Decided that "down" was the new "up."
Suspect 3: Gremlins (okay, maybe not, but we checked).
Immediate Actions Taken
Panic!
Just kidding, we’re professionals! But there was a collective gasp.
Alert the Team
A quick Slack message and our team was on the case like detectives at a crime scene.
Restart the Server
Turned it off and on again – because sometimes, the oldest tricks are the best.
Checked Logs
Sifted through logs like archaeologists looking for clues.
Resolution and Recovery
Within 45 minutes, our site was back up, and the server was apologizing profusely (or at least we like to think so). We pinpointed the issue to the misconfigured cron job and made the necessary corrections.

What We Learned (a.k.a. The Moral of the Story)
Cron Jobs Are Powerful (But With Great Power...)
Always double-check your settings, or your server might decide to "take a break."
Monitoring is Key
A bit more attention to monitoring could have saved us from the 3:00 AM excitement.
Humor Helps
When things go wrong, sometimes it’s best to laugh (after fixing the problem, of course).
The Fix (Visually Appealing Diagram)
Here’s a simple diagram of our server’s journey from working fine to its brief vacation and back:


Server Online →
Cron Job Misfire →
Server Offline →
Team Investigates →
Fix Applied →
Server Online Again
Conclusion
Every incident is a learning opportunity, even if it means a bit of chaos at 3:00 AM. We’ve fine-tuned our processes, and next time, we’ll catch it before it catches us. And maybe, just maybe, our server will think twice before taking another unapproved vacation.
